v0.5.0
------
- Added networking to mrv2.  You can have a server and one or more clients and
  they will all colaborate with UI, pan and zoom, color transformations,
  playback, audio and annotations.  They can all be set to send or accept any
  item individually, from either the Preferences or the Sync menu.
  The server should contain the media to be reviewed.  Upon a connection by any
  client, the client will attempt to synchronize with the server.
  The sever and client are on a LAN and if both the client and server use the
  same paths to the media, the client will get all of its media loaded
  automatically.
  If they don't have the same paths, each file will be to the list of path
  mappings set in the Preferences.
  Finally, if that fails, the files will be compared on its base name
  and if matched, it will get accepted as the same clip, with a warning.
  If none of this is true, an error will appear, but the connection will
  continue.  However, syncing among multiple clips may show the wrong clip.
- Added Path Mapping to deal with paths being different on each platform, client
  or server.
- Fixed dragging of the timeline outside of the in-out range.  Now it will
  clamp the slider.
- Fixed a subtle bug in translations of Preferences' tree view which could lead
  to the wizard panel not show.
- Fixed a potential crash on log panel opening (when it was already opened).
- Fixed a bug on Windows and macOS that would size the panels beyond the bottom
  of the window.
- Added Environment Map options to python API.
- Fixed Luminance label spilling into the black areas of the pixel bar.
- Fixed Luminance tooltip flickering on macOS.
- Fixed Media Info Panel not showing up when the dockgroup was created for the
  first time.
- Fixed cursor disappearing on the action tool bar when a draw mode was
  selected.  Now it only disappears when it is in one of the views.
- Added saving of annotations when saving movie files or sequence of images.
