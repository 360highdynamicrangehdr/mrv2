#
# To build you first need to get the tlRender as a git submodule
#

To build it, run:

$ runme.sh

It will create a build and a BUILD-KERNEL-ARCH/BUILDTYPE/install directory where Ã§all files shall reside.

Later, if you just want to build mrViewer without running through all the
dependencies, run:

$ runmeq.sh

Later, to build FLTK, tlRender and mrViewer, run;

$ runmet.sh
