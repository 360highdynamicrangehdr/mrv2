# Instructions to build mrViewer 2 ( mrv2 )
#

To build it, run:

$ runme.sh

It will create a build and a BUILD-KERNEL-ARCH/BUILDTYPE/install directory
where Ã§all files shall reside.

Later, if you just want to build mrViewer without running through all the
dependencies, run:

$ runmeq.sh

Later, to just build FLTK, tlRender and mrViewer, run;

$ runmet.sh


WINDOWS NOTE
============

The windows compilation does not compile the ffmpeg, libintl nor the libiconv
libraries.  These have to be compiled manually with MSys/MingW or with
Windows' WSL, using gcc instead of Visual Studio CL.exe.

As a convernience for Windows users, DLLs, includes and .lib files for those
libraries are provided in mrViewer's windows/win32 and windows/win64
directories.

libint and libicon do not update often.

However ffmpeg does, so it is suggested you learn how to compile it.
A very good way is to use the media autobuild suite, which runs under MSys.

It can be obtained from:

https://github.com/m-ab-s/media-autobuild_suite

As a bonus, you can replace the LGPL ffmpeg that ships with mrv2 with a more
complete GPL one.
