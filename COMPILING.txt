# To build you first need to get the tlRender as a git submodule
#

You do it like:

$ git submodule add https://github.com/ggarra13/tlRender.git

Then to build it, run:

$ runme.sh

It will create a build and a build/install directory where all files shall
reside.

Later, if you just want to build mrViewer without running through all the
dependencies, run:

$ runmeq.sh
